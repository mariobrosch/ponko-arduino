Please report any bugs and please create a pull request if something can be better!

## Why is the right arm not moving since the right arm is in the code?
I'm aware this is a 'mistake', but have choosen to let it like this. When you see Ponko from front, it's the right right arm.

## Why is the left arm not moving?
A have choosen to don't move the arm, since that arm is holding the guitar and is a big weight.
